Hello! I'm Luca Grillotti, a PhD student at the [Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics Lab (AIRL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) of Imperial College London under the supervision of [Dr Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully).

My research focuses on how to use [**Quality-Diversity**](https://quality-diversity.github.io/) and **Reinforcement Learning** algorithms to learn collections of **diverse robot skills** in an **unsupervised** manner without simulation models.
[This poster](/assets/pdf/LSR-4-1.pdf) summarises the research conducted during my first months of PhD.

Additionally, I actively contribute to several open-source Quality-Diversity projects, such as [QDax](https://github.com/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/QDax) and [Kheperax](https://github.com/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/Kheperax).
Beyond coding, I co-organize the [Imperial College Autonomous Learning and Reasoning (ICARL)](https://icarl.doc.ic.ac.uk/) monthly seminar series, where researchers in the field are invited to present their work on campus.

As a **Teaching Scholar** for the Department of Computing, I've made substantial contributions to education at Imperial College London. 
For example, I gave several _PyTorch lectures_, designed the corresponding [lecture notes](https://python.pages.doc.ic.ac.uk/2022/lessons/pytorch/01-intro/index.html), and taught half of a _[Computational Techniques module](https://sites.google.com/view/computational-techniques-2022/)_.
I hold a [Postgraduate Certificate in University Learning and Teaching](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/educational-development/programmes/pg-cert-ult/) (PGCert ULT), with specialized training in _approaches to teaching_ and _digital learning_.
