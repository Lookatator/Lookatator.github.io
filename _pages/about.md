Hol√†! I'm Luca Grillotti, a PhD student at the [Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics Lab (AIRL)]() of Imperial College London under the supervision of [Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully).

My research focuses on how to use **Reinforcement Learning** and [**Quality-Diversity**](https://quality-diversity.github.io/) algorithms to learn collections of **diverse** and **high-performing robot abilities** in an **unsupervised** manner.

I also work as **Teaching Scholar** for the Department of Computing.
I had the opportunity to give several _PyTorch lectures_ and design the corresponding [lecture notes](), teach half of a _[Computational Techniques module]()_, create many _Python Programming_ and _Probabilistic Inference_ assignments from scratch, and work as teaching assistant for the _[Reinforcement Learning]()_ and _[Mathematics]()_ modules.

While working as a Teaching Scholar, I obtained a [Postgraduate Certificate in University Learning and Teaching](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/educational-development/programmes/pg-cert-ult/) (PGCert ULT) in 2022.
The PGCert programme included several courses about teaching and learning in the university setting, such as: _approaches to teaching_, _how students learn_, _digital learning_ and _educational supervision_.

[This poster](/assets/pdf/LSR-4-1.pdf) summarises the research conducted during my first months of PhD.
